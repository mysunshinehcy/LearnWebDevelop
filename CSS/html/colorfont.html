        Emerging Into The Light

    <p>
        When the city of <a href="">Seattle</a> was found,it was on a tidal flood plain in 
        <a href="">Puget Sound</a> If this seems like a bad move,it was,but then <a href="">the founders</a> were
        men from the Midwests who didn't know a whole lot about tides.You'd think they'd have figureed it all
        out before actullay building the town,but apparently not. A city was established right there,and construction
        work began.
