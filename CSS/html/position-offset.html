        When we consider the effect of positioning,it quickly becomes clear that
        authors can do a great deal of damage to layout,just as they can do very
        interesting things.

            [4]
        </span>
        This is usually the case with useful technologies:the sword always
        has at least two edges,both of them sharp.
