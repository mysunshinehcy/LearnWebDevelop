    <h1>
        Emerging Into The Light.
    </h1>
    <p>
        when the city of <a>Seattle</a> was found,it was on a tidal flood in the  <a>Puget Sound</a>
        If this seems like a bad move,it was,but then <a>the founders</a> were men from the 
        Midwest who didn't know a whole lot about tides.You'd think they'd have figured it all
        out before actually building the town,but apparently not .A city was established right
        there.and constructor work began.
    </p>
    <h2>
        A Capital Flood.
    </h2>
    <p>
        The financial district had it the worst,apparently.Every time the tide came in,the whole
        area would flood.As bad as that sounds,it's even worse when you consider that a 
        large grounw of humans clusteted togehter for many hours everyday until.
