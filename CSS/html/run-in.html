        Another interseting block/inline hybrid is the value <code>run-in</code>
        introduced in CSS2,which has the ability to take block-level elements and make
        them an inline part of a following element.This is useful for certain
        heading effects that are quite common in print typography,where a heading will
        appear as part of a paragraph of text.

            This paragraph is contained within a DIV that has a width of 200 pixels,
            so its padding will be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent element.
            Given the declared width of 200 pixels,the padding will be 20 pixels on all sides.

            This paragraph is contained within a DIV with a width of 100 pixels,so its padding will 
            still be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent.There will,therefore,be half as much padding on
             this paragraph as that on the first paragrapgh.
